# Working with Express.js

## What is Express.js?

- Express.js is a Node.js framework - a package that adds a bunch of utility functions, tools and a clear set of rules on how the app should be built (middleware, routing, etc.).
- It's highly extensible and other packages can be plugged into it.

## Middleware, next() and res()

- Express.js relies heavily on middleware functions - you can easily add them by calling `app.use()`.
- Middleware functions handle a request and should call `next()` to forward the request to the next function in line or send a response.

## Routing

- You can filter requests by path and method.
- If you filter by method, paths are matched exactly, otherwise, the first segment of a URL is matched.
- You can use the `express.Router` to split your routes across files elegantly.

## Serve Files

- You're not limited to serving dummy text as a response - you can serve files as well.
- You can `sendFile()s` to your users - e.g. to serve HTML files.
- If a request is directly made for a file (e.g. a .css file is requested), you can enable serving static files with `express.static()`.
